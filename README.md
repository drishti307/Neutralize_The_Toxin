## Neutralize_The_Toxin- An implementation and comparison of various ML techniques to classify toxic comments
This project addresses the need to identify and classify toxic online comments. It introduces the various approaches and algorithms used for classification of toxic comments into six categories. These were evaluated on a large number of Wikipedia TalkPage comments from the Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification Challenge. Exploratory data analysis has been performed to understand underlying patterns, trends and relationships in the data. Algorithms namely, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, SVM, and KNN have been applied. Additionally, Easy Data Augmentation is performed and its efficacy is analysed.
